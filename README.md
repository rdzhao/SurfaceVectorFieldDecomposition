# Surface Vector Field Decomposition

This project is a downstream application based on [MagicView](https://github.com/rdzhao/MagicView), a minimalistic OpenGL GUI for viewing 3D models.

For a input smooth piece-wise constant vector field defined on each face of triangle mesh, this project can decompose the vector field into the exact component (curl-free), coexact component (divergence-free) and harmonic component (curl-free and divergence-free).

## Example
